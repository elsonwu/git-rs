## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Current Test Coverage

```text
Total Tests: 35+ (clone tests pending)
├── Domain Tests: 8 (repository, objects, remote objects)
├── Infrastructure Tests: 12 (stores, persistence, remote client)
├── Application Tests: 23+ (commands, workflows, clone workflow)
```

### Test Organization

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Command workflows
- **Property Tests**: Hash consistency and correctness
- **Cross-platform Tests**: Platform-specific behavior

### Known Test Issues

Some tests fail after `.git-rs` migration due to:

- File paths in test fixtures
- Missing test files in temporary directories
- Directory structure assumptions

**Fix Strategy**: Update test fixtures and use proper temporary directory setup.

## 📊 Code Metrics

### Codebase Size

```text
Language      Lines    Files
Rust          ~3,200   20 files
Markdown      ~900     4 docs
Total         ~4,100   24 files
```

### Architecture Distribution

```text
├── Domain (35%): Core business logic + remote objects
├── Infrastructure (25%): File system + HTTP operations
├── Application (25%): Use case implementations  
├── CLI (10%): Command line interface
└── Tests (5%): Test code
```

## 🎯 Educational Goals Progress

### ✅ Achieved Learning Objectives

- **Git Object Model**: Blob, tree, commit objects implemented
- **Content Addressing**: SHA-1 hashing and storage mechanics
- **Three Trees Concept**: Working directory, index, HEAD relationships
- **Reference System**: Branch and HEAD pointer management
- **Status Algorithm**: File change detection through hash comparison

### 🎓 Next Learning Phases

1. **Commit History**: Building and traversing commit graphs
2. **Diff Algorithms**: Content comparison and patch generation
3. **Network Protocols**: Remote repository communication
4. **Advanced Features**: Merging, rebasing, conflict resolution

## 🔧 Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (for latest features)
- Cargo (included with Rust)
- Git (for development workflow)

### Key Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
clap = "4.0"           # Command line parsing
serde = "1.0"          # Serialization
serde_json = "1.0"     # JSON handling
sha1 = "0.10"          # Hash calculation
flate2 = "1.0"         # Compression
hex = "0.4"            # Hex encoding
tempfile = "3.0"       # Test utilities
chrono = "0.4"         # Timestamp handling
reqwest = "0.11"       # HTTP client for remote operations
url = "2.4"            # URL parsing and manipulation
```

### Build and Test

```bash
# Build project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run specific test module
cargo test domain::

# Build documentation
cargo doc --open

# Check code quality
cargo clippy
cargo fmt
```

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Object Storage

- **Compression**: ~60-80% size reduction with zlib
- **Hash Performance**: ~500MB/s on modern hardware
- **Directory Sharding**: Prevents filesystem limitations

### Memory Usage

- **Streaming**: Large files processed without full load
- **Index Caching**: In-memory staging area representation
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse allocations where possible

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Constraints

- **Single Repository**: No sub-modules or worktrees
- **HTTP Only**: SSH remote support not yet implemented
- **Basic Gitignore**: Simple pattern matching only
- **No Merge Support**: Linear history only
- **Clone Authentication**: No authentication support yet

### Planned Improvements

- **SSH Protocol**: Secure remote repository access
- **Authentication**: Username/password and SSH key support
- **Advanced Gitignore**: Full specification compliance
- **Merge Strategies**: Three-way merge implementation
