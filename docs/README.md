# Git-RS Documentation Index üìö

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Git-RS, an educational Git implementation in Rust!

## üìñ Documentation Overview

### Core Documentation

- **[Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Deep dive into Git internals, object model, and the three-trees concept
- **[Command Reference](COMMANDS.md)** - Complete reference for all implemented git-rs commands
- **[Git Internals Explained](GIT_INTERNALS.md)** - Educational exploration of how Git works under the hood
- **[Project Status](STATUS.md)** - Development roadmap, test coverage, and contribution guidelines

### Quick Links

- **[Main README](../README.md)** - Project overview and getting started
- **[API Documentation](https://elsonwu.github.io/git-rs/)** - Generated Rust API docs
- **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/elsonwu/git-rs)** - Source code and issue tracking

## üéØ Learning Path

### For Git Beginners

1. Start with the [Main README](../README.md) for project overview
2. Read [Git Internals Explained](GIT_INTERNALS.md) to understand core concepts
3. Try the hands-on examples in [Command Reference](COMMANDS.md)
4. Explore the [Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md) for implementation details

### For Developers

1. Review [Project Status](STATUS.md) for current state and roadmap
2. Study [Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design
3. Check [API Documentation](https://elsonwu.github.io/git-rs/) for code reference
4. Follow the contribution guidelines in [Project Status](STATUS.md)

### For Rust Learners

1. Examine the [Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md) for Domain-Driven Design patterns
2. Browse the [API Documentation](https://elsonwu.github.io/git-rs/) for Rust idioms
3. Look at GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` for CI/CD examples

## üîç Key Concepts Covered

### Git Internals

- **Object Storage**: How blobs, trees, and commits are stored and retrieved
- **Content Addressing**: SHA-1 hashing and object identification
- **References**: Branches, tags, and HEAD management
- **Index/Staging Area**: The three-trees model (working dir, index, HEAD)

### Rust Implementation

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clean architecture with separated concerns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and Result patterns
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and property-based testing
- **Documentation**: rustdoc examples and educational comments

### DevOps & Quality

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions for testing, linting, and releases
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Documentation**: Automated docs generation and link validation
- **Security**: Dependency auditing and vulnerability scanning

## ü§ù Contributing to Documentation

Found an error or want to improve the documentation? Great! Here's how:

1. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b docs/improve-something`
2. **Make your changes** to the relevant files in the `docs/` folder
3. **Test links**: Run `markdown-link-check docs/*.md` if available
4. **Submit a PR**: Push your branch and create a pull request

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, beginner-friendly language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Add diagrams for complex concepts (ASCII art is fine!)
- Link between related sections
- Keep educational focus in mind

## üÜò Getting Help

- **Questions about Git concepts**: Check [Git Internals Explained](GIT_INTERNALS.md)
- **Usage questions**: See [Command Reference](COMMANDS.md)
- **Implementation questions**: Review [Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Bug reports**: Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/elsonwu/git-rs/issues)
- **Feature requests**: Check [Project Status](STATUS.md) and open an issue
