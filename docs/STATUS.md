## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Current Test Coverage

```text
Total Tests: 67
├── Domain Tests: 11 (repository, remote objects)  
├── Infrastructure Tests: 16 (stores, remote client, persistence)
├── Application Tests: 38 (commands, workflows)
├── Integration Tests: 17 (diff, clone scenarios)
├── Doc Tests: 2 (documentation examples)
```

### Test Organization

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Command workflows
- **Property Tests**: Hash consistency and correctness
- **Cross-platform Tests**: Platform-specific behavior

### Known Test Issues

Some tests fail after `.git-rs` migration due to:

- File paths in test fixtures
- Missing test files in temporary directories
- Directory structure assumptions

**Fix Strategy**: Update test fixtures and use proper temporary directory setup.

## 🔧 Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (for latest features)
- Cargo (included with Rust)
- Git (for development workflow)

### Key Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
clap = "4.0"           # Command line parsing
serde = "1.0"          # Serialization
serde_json = "1.0"     # JSON handling
sha1 = "0.10"          # Hash calculation
flate2 = "1.0"         # Compression
hex = "0.4"            # Hex encoding
tempfile = "3.0"       # Test utilities
chrono = "0.4"         # Timestamp handling
reqwest = "0.11"       # HTTP client for remote operations
url = "2.4"            # URL parsing and validation
```

### Build and Test

```bash
# Build project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run specific test module
cargo test domain::

# Build documentation
cargo doc --open

# Check code quality
cargo clippy
cargo fmt
```

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Object Storage

- **Hash Performance**: ~500MB/s on modern hardware
- **Directory Sharding**: Prevents filesystem limitations

### Memory Usage

- **Streaming**: Large files processed without full load
- **Index Caching**: In-memory staging area representation
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse allocations where possible

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Constraints

- **Single Repository**: No sub-modules or worktrees
- **HTTP Only**: Clone supports HTTP protocol, SSH planned for future
- **Basic Gitignore**: Simple pattern matching only
